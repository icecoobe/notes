# Overview

## Bjarne Talks about the C++ language

### How to learn C++, what is the best strategy to learn C++

I think first you need an overview of the language.<br>
A lot of students dig in and want to know everything about some little detail.
But the point is , they can't understand it until they have a broader view of the language.


As people go in and they see, oh, pointers.<br>
Great, I want to know everything about pointers, and why would you want to do that?


They should be work together with classes and other data types, and how do you do a traversal or a container and such.


You shouldn't obsess about one little thing, or they  go in and they say, well, there're 32 different basic arithmetic types. It's probably right. I can't remember. 


I mean, that's just the sew of little type or rules for conversion. 
Most of the time, I don't use all of those types, and most of the time, I don't have to think about those things.


So instead of digging into the little details, pointers, how to do a class, hierarchy, things like that, get an overview.

### What should students focus on when learning C++?

I think first of all they should try and look at C++ as a modern language.

Far too many have learned C++ as if it was just C or as if it was still 1985, and that pains me a lot because it's much better these days. 

You look at it and you see how to use the abstraction mechanisms, you use the libraries.

They are the standard library which is fundamental data structures, few algorithms, timing, regular expressions, that kind of stuff. 

Then there are specific libraries for specific areas, the database interfaces, you have specific graphic libraries, animations libraries, and such.


So I think when you start programming, you stick to the fundamentals for a while, because well , the fundamentals are the fundamentals. 


You have to know your algorithms, you have to know your data structures, you have to know a little bit of machine architecture if you want to write at that level.


Then you're going to actually do something. If you're writing video game, you have to know what game's engine and the libraries that go in there.


So you go through the fundamentals and then something specific to your interest.

## 编译型语言vs解释型语言

**编译型语言**会在编译阶段将错误或者潜在的风险提示出来；<br>
相反动态类型语言可能会在运行时期报错，但是这时候用户是无法处理这些问题的，因为他们很可能不是开发人员。<br>

编译器是开发人员的好帮手，可以生成代码，转换代码，也可以发现风险。<br>

编译型语言的优势也是劣势，相比动态类型语言，我们需要先通过编译器生成目标平台上的可执行文件，再将该文件发布给用户；因此，为了支持多种平台，我们还需要针对每个平台编译生成对应的目标文件，再将其提供给用户。甚至还需要为了目标平台而去构建**交叉编译工具链**。<br>

还有一个优势，编译型的语言生成的是最终可执行的目标文件，因此**运行效率高**。

**动态类型语言**（比如python，JavaScript等）拥有很好的跨平台特性以及容易上手等特点。<br>

因此，在web开发、系统管理等方面非常适合使用这一类型的语言，当下他们也获得了蓬勃的发展。<br>

还有一种场景适合动态类型语言，当目标场景是交互式的时候，此时效率不是那么重要。比如AI和数据科学实验时，使用Jupyter Notebook进行即时开发，用户无需频繁地等待编译器处理&执行修改后的代码这个繁琐的流程。<br>

动态类型的语言往往**运行效率比较低**，因为大多数是解释型语言，在运行时依赖解释器逐行将代码转换成目标系统的指令来运行。
