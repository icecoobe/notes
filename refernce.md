>This design was motivated by the Class-Responsibility-Collaborator technique
>described in [Bud91]: We identify objects more or less by looking at the problem.
>An object is given certain responsibilities to carry out. This leads to other objects
>which collaborate in carrying out the work. Once the objects are known, they are
>collected into classes and, hopefully, a hierarchical pattern can be found that is
>deeper than just one level.
>The key idea for this application is the Ic class with the capability of receiving,
>changing, and routing information. This idea was inspired by the Interface Builder
>of NeXTSTEP where much of the information flow, even to application-specific
>classes, can be ‘‘wired’’ by mouse-dragging when the graphical user interface is
>designed with a graphics editor
